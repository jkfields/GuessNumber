# GuessNumber

Playing around with some basic coding projects.  Feel free to use or ignore.  Comments and improvements always welcomed.

This should run in either Python 2 or 3.

Output:

Hello! What is your name? Jeff

Jeff, let's play a game. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20.

Take a guess (1 of 4). 5
Your guess is too high.

Take a guess (2 of 4). 3
Excellent, Jeff! You guessed the number in 2 guesses!
